Coding is one of my favorite things and I've taken a class for it int 9th grade. I have also taught my self a bit of C# coding with Unity over the summer.

If I'm not coding some other things I enjoy are engineering, rock climbing, and video games.

My goals with this class are to expand my knowledge on computer science and be more efficient at what I already do.
